# honest-randomizer
A simple randomizer, written in one hour.

You just enter all participants to the text box (one participant = one row).

And then you should press the "Rollup" button.

It was written to be as simple randomizer, 
without any thirdparties with code that you can read on the one (or two) display(s).
